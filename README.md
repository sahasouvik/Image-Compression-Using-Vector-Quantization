# Image-Compression-Using-Vector-Quantization
In this problem we have worked with the grayscale image of P.C. Mahalanobis. Then we have performed image compression using Vector Quantization by the help of the clustering algorithm K-means which is also known as "Llyod's algorithm" in computer science and engineering.
